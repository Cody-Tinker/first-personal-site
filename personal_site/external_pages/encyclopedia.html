    <h1>Mathematics</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Mathematics is the study of numbers, shapes and patterns. The word comes
      from the Greek word "μάθημα" (máthema), meaning "science, knowledge, or
      learning", and is sometimes shortened to maths (in England, Australia,
      Ireland, and New Zealand) or math (in the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">United States</a>
      and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada">Canada</a>). The short
      words are often used for arithmetic, geometry or simple algebra by
      students and their schools.

    <h2>Mathematics includes the study of:</h2>

    <p>
      <span style="font-weight: bold">Numbers:</span> how things can be counted
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style="font-weight: bold">Structure:</span> how things are
      organized. This subfield is usually called algebra.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style="font-weight: bold">Place:</span> where things are and tehir
      arrangement. This subfield is usually called geometry.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style="font-weight: bold">Change:</span> how things become
      different. This subfield is usually called analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathematics is useful for solving problems that occur in the real world,
      so many people besides mathematicians study and use mathematics. Today,
      some mathematics is needed in many jobs. People working in business,
      science, engineering, and construction need some knowledge of mathematics.
